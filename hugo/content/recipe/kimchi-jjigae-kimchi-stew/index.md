directions:
- Before You Start...
- Please note that if you have not prepared your anchovy stock ahead of time, it will
  take at least 20-30 minutes to make. See my recipe below.
- Gather all the ingredients.
- To Make the Anchovy Stock (if you haven't made it yet)
- I use these big and thick dried anchovies (called iriko from a Japanese market).
  Remove the head, belly (the bottom side), and black gut from the fish to reduce
  the bitter flavor of the stock. Soak the anchovies in the water for at least 20-30
  minutes (or overnight). This is a cold brew anchovy stock called Iriko Dashi in
  Japanese.
- Transfer the cold brew iriko dashi and anchovies into a small saucepan and slowly
  bring it to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 8-10 minutes.
  Turn off the heat and set it aside.
- To Prepare the Ingredients
- "Cut the tofu in half along the long side and cut into \xBD-inch (1.3-cm) slices."
- Thinly slice the green onion diagonally. Separate the white and green parts.
- "Cut the pork belly slices into 1\xBD- to 2-inch-wide pieces."
- To Cook the Kimchi Jjigae
- "Set a medium or large pot on medium heat. Once it\u2019s hot, add the sesame oil\
  \ and pork belly."
- Cook, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes, or until no longer pink. Season with
  the salt and black pepper.
- Add the sake and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute.
- Add the white parts of the green onions and the kimchi. If the kimchi is not cut
  yet, use a pair of scissors to cut it into bite-size pieces.
- Add the minced/crushed garlic (I use this garlic press) and cook, stirring frequently,
  for 2-3 minutes until the kimchi is tender.
- Add the gochugaru, gochujang, soy sauce, and sugar.
- Stir to mix. Next, add the anchovy stock by straining it through a fine-mesh sieve
  over the pot. Then, add the kimchi juice, if there is any (I didn't have any).
- Bring it to a boil, and then lower the heat to a simmer. Continue to cook for 10
  minutes.
- Add the tofu slices on top and cook until the tofu is heated through, about 5 minutes.
  You can submerge the tofu, but I left it on top to keep the tofu's white color for
  the final presentation.
- Garnish with green onions and keep it covered until ready to serve.
- To Serve
- Serve bubbling hot in individual bowls. You can serve Kimchi Jjigae with a bowl
  of hot steamed rice and some meat or fish (Bulgogi, Grilled Mackerel, etc).
- To Store
- You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and keep them for 3 days in
  the refrigerator or for up to a month in the freezer. When you freeze it, remove
  the tofu as its texture will change when frozen. You can add fresh tofu when reheating
  the stew in a pot on the stovetop over medium heat.
