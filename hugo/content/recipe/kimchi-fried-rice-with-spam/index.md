directions:
- Fry the Spam
- Heat a pan over medium high heat and add about a tablespoon of the oil and the cubed
  spam. Fry the spam until it's browned and crispy on one side and them flip it over
  and brown the other side. This should take about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove it from
  the pan and set it aside.
- Fry the Kimchi
- Add the remaining oil to the pan and add the kimchi, gochujang, and Korean red pepper
  flakes. Stir fry it together for about 3 to 4 minutes.
- Add the Rice
- Add the day old rice to the pan and break up any large clumps of rice by pressing
  down with the flat side of your spatula or spoon. Keep stirring together to make
  sure each grain of rice is coated with the kimchi and oil.
- Add the remaining ingredients.
- "Add the spam back into the pan along with the kimchi juice and sesame oil. Stir\
  \ fry everything together. Give it a taste at this point to see if the flavors are\
  \ balanced. If your kimchi is very ripe, it may be too sour and may need a bit of\
  \ sugar to balance out the flavors. Add \xBD teaspoon of sugar if needed and taste\
  \ again. Otherwise, leave out the sugar (see notes below for additional information).\
  \ Remove from the heat and portion out the servings."
- Garnish and Serve
- 'Optional: Top with a sunny side up egg and garnish with chopped scallions and sesame
  seeds. Serve immediately.'
