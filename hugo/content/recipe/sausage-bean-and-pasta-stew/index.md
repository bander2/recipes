date: '2023-06-08T19:52:43Z'
directions:
- Spread the onions over the bottom of a 5 1/2- to 6-quart slow cooker and top with
  the carrots, garlic, white beans, thyme bundle and sausage links. Mix the diced
  tomatoes with the broth and 3 cups water and pour over the sausages. Add the Parmesan
  rind if using.
- Cook on high for 4 to 5 hours or on low for 7 to 8 hours; the beans will be tender
  and begin to fall apart.
- Uncover the slow cooker, remove and discard the thyme bundle and Parmesan rind and
  transfer the sausage links to a cutting board. Stir the pasta into the stew and
  continue to cook, covered, until the pasta is cooked through, about 20 minutes.
- Turn off the heat. Cut the sausages into bite-size pieces and stir into the stew
  along with the parsley and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with grated
  Parmesan on the side for sprinkling on top and crusty bread for soaking up the broth.
