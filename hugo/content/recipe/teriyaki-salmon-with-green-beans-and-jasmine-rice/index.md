directions:
- Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Peel ginger, then mince until
  you have 2 tsp. Trim, then thinly slice scallions, keeping greens and whites separate.
  Cut lime into wedges. Place rice in a fine mesh sieve and rinse under running water.
- "Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add ginger and scallion\
  \ whites and cook, tossing, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add rice and toss to coat.\
  \ Pour in 1\xBC cups water and add a large pinch of salt. Cover, bring to a boil,\
  \ then lower heat and let simmer until water is absorbed, 15-20 minutes."
- Meanwhile, place salmon skin-side down in the center of a baking sheet and season
  with salt and pepper. Sprinkle each fillet with a drizzle of olive oil. Toss green
  beans with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper on same sheet. Roast in oven
  until salmon is opaque on surface but not cooked through, about 5 minutes.
- While salmon and green beans roast, place teriyaki sauce in a small pan over medium
  heat. Bring to a simmer and let bubble until thick and glaze-like, about 3 minutes.
  Set aside 2 TBSP sauce for brushing the fish and reserve the rest for serving, keeping
  the two separate.
- After salmon and green beans have roasted 5 minutes, remove baking sheet from oven.
  Heat broiler to high. Brush 1 TBSP teriyaki sauce onto one salmon fillet, then sprinkle
  with sesame seeds. Repeat with other fillet. Place sheet under broiler and broil
  until salmon is cooked to desired doneness and green beans are lightly browned,
  3-4 minutes.
- Fluff rice with a fork, then season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lime. Divide
  between plates, then top with salmon and green beans. Garnish with scallion greens.
  Serve with lime wedges and reserved teriyaki sauce on the side for drizzling over.
